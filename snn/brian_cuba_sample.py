# This script defines a randomly connected network of 4000 leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with exponential synaptic currents, partitioned into a group of 3200 excitatory neurons and 800 inhibitory neurons. 
# The subgroup() method keeps track of which neurons have been allocated to subgroups and allocates the next available neurons. 
# The process starts from neuron 0, so Pe has neurons 0 through 3199 and Pi has neurons 3200 through 3999. 
# The script outputs a raster plot showing the spiking activity of the network for a few hundred ms. 
# This is Brian's implementation of the current-based (CUBA) network model used as one of the benchmarks in Brette et al. (2007), based on the network studied in Vogels and Abbott (2005). 
# The simulation takes 3â€“4 s on a typical PC (1.8 GHz Pentium), for 1 s of biological time (with dt = 0.1 ms). 
# The variables ge and gi are not conductances, we follow the variable names used in Brette et al. (2007). 
# The code :volt in the equations means that the unit of the variable being defined (V, ge and gi) has units of volts.
