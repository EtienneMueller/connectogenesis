# Connectogenesis

Analysis tools for understanding neural connectivity development in zebrafish larvae through longitudinal brain imaging.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of scripts developed during postdoctoral research in AI and computational neuroscience to analyse zebrafish larvae brain imaging data recorded over multiple days. The primary goal is to identify and characterise growth algorithms governing brain development through connectivity pattern analysis.

## Background

Zebrafish larvae provide an excellent model system for studying neural development due to their transparent brains and rapid development. By tracking neural connectivity patterns over time, we can uncover fundamental principles of how brain networks self-organize during early development.

## Data

The analysis pipeline is designed for:
- **Species**: Zebrafish larvae (*Danio rerio*)
- **Imaging modality**: Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM)
- **Temporal resolution**: 4x 600s
- **Spatial resolution**: tbd
- **Age range**: 3-6 days post-fertilization (dpf)
